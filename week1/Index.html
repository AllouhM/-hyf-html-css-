            <ul>
                <li>Interleaving Strategy: I am a big fan of interleaving strategy of learning or interleaved practice. It is simply about not to spend all the time of the study session on one topic, on the contrary, I spend the time of my study session on many topics. This practice not only teaches me how to solve the problem but also when to solve this problem. This is the result of mixing all topics together and try to find connections between them. </li>
                <li>Spaced practice: Or distributed practice, it is to divide the topic to many study sessions over a long period of time, and when you study the recent topic go back and restudy the topic before, and so on. This parctice  gives spaces to the brain to let him settel the information he got down and fix it. One disadvantage of this strategy, that it does not work if you have short deadlines.</li>
