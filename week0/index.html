        <h2>Why do I admire and love<em> Mahmoud Darwish?</em> </h2>

        <p id="love-mahmoud-darwish"> <img id="mahmoud-photo" src="https://s13.postimg.org/3jufdac2v/1_ees06_Kb8r_MRBTp_R-nd88_w.jpg" alt="This photo for Mahmoud Darwish with quote" width=400;>I am a child of Palestinian parents who born in Palestine. My parents conveyed to me all
          their memories in Palestine and all love feelings towards Palestine. To know Palestine you should definitely know <span class="MD-color"><strong><em>Mahmoud Darwish</em></strong></span> as he is a symbol, an icon of Palestine. His poems became
          a bridge between me and Palestine which existed only in my thoughts. This poem is one of his masterpieces and I love it very much. On This Earth What Makes Life Worth Living By <span class="MD-color"><strong><em>Mahmoud Darwish</em></strong></span>          Translated by Karim Abuawad On this earth what makes life worth living: the hesitance of April the scent of bread at dawn an amulet made by a woman for men Aeschylus’s works the beginnings of love moss on a stone the mothers standing on the
          thinness of a flute and the fear of invaders of memories. On this earth what makes life worth living: September’s end a lady moving beyond her fortieth year without losing any of her grace a sun clock in a prison cloud imitating a flock of creatures
          chants of a crowd for those meeting their end smiling and the fear of tyrants of the songs. On this earth what makes life worth living: on this earth stands the mistress of the earth mother of beginnings mother of endings it used to be known
          as Palestine it became known as Palestine my mistress: I deserve, because you’re my mistress I deserve life.</p>

        <h3 id="Literary-career" class="h3-css">Literary career</h3>
        <p> Over his lifetime, Darwish published more than 30 volumes of poetry and eight books of prose. At one time or another, he was editor of the periodicals Al-Jadid, Al-Fajr, Shu'un Filistiniyya, and Al-Karmel. By the age of seventeen, Darwish was
          writing poetry about the suffering of the refugees in the Nakba and the inevitability of their return, and had begun reciting his poems at poetry festivals. Seven years later, on 1 May 1965, when the young Darwish read his poem "Bitaqat huwiyya"
          ["Identity Card"] to a crowd in a Nazareth movie house, there was a tumultuous reaction. Within days the poem had spread throughout the country and the Arab world. Published in his second volume "Leaves of Olives" (Haifa, 1964), the six stanzas
          of the poem repeat the cry "Write down: I am an Arab."In the 1970s, "Darwish, as a Palestinian poet of the Resistance committed himself to the ... objective of nurturing the vision of defeat and disaster (after the June War of 1967), so much
          so that it would 'gnaw at the hearts' of the forthcoming generations." Darwish addressed the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Ward aqall [Fewer Roses] (1986) and "Sa-ya'ti barabira akharun" ("Other Barbarians Will Come"). Darwish's work has won
          numerous awards and been published in 20 languages. A central theme in Darwish's poetry is the concept of watan or homeland. The poet Naomi Shihab Nye wrote that Darwish "is the essential breath of the Palestinian people, the eloquent witness
          of exile and belonging...." Among his awards was the "Cultural Freedom Prize" by the United States Lannan Foundation, for the stated purpose of recognizing "people whose extraordinary and courageous work celebrates the human right to freedom
          of imagination, inquiry, and expression."

        <h3 id="Writing-style" class="h3-css">Writing style</h3>
        <p>Darwish's early writings are in the classical Arabic style. He wrote monorhymed poems adhering to the metrics of traditional Arabic poetry. In the 1970s he began to stray from these precepts and adopted a "free-verse" technique that did not abide
          strictly by classical poetic norms. The quasi-Romantic diction of his early works gave way to a more personal, flexible language, and the slogans and declarative language that characterized his early poetry were replaced by indirect and ostensibly
          apolitical statements, although politics was never far away.</p>

        <h3 id="Literary-influences" class="h3-css">Literary influences</h3>
        <p>Darwish was impressed by the Iraqi poets Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. He cited Rimbaud and Ginsberg as literary influences. Darwish admired the Hebrew poet Yehuda Amichai, but described his poetry as a "challenge to me, because
          we write about the same place. He wants to use the landscape and history for his own benefit, based on my destroyed identity. So we have a competition: who is the owner of the language of this land? Who loves it more? Who writes it better? </p>

        <h3 id="Death-Mahmoud-Darwish" class="h3-css">Death </h3>
        <p>
          <span class="MD-color"><strong><em>Mahmoud Darwish</em></strong></span> died on 9 August 2008 at the age of 66, three days after heart surgery at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas. Before surgery, Darwish had signed a document asking
          not to be resuscitated in the event of brain death. According to Ibrahim Muhawi, the poet, though suffering from serious heart problems, did not require urgent surgery, and the day set for the operation bore a symbolic resonance. In his Memory
          for Forgetfulness, Darwish centered the narrative of Israel's invasion of Lebanon and 88-day siege of Beirut on 6 August 1982, which was the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. A new bomb had been deployed, which could collapse and level
          a 12-storey building by creating a vacuum. Darwish wrote: "On this day, on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, they are trying out the vacuum bomb on our flesh and the experiment is successful." By his choice of that day for surgery, Muwahi
          suggests, Darwish was documenting: "the nothingness he saw lying ahead for the Palestinian people. Early reports of his death in the Arabic press indicated that Darwish had asked in his will to be buried in Palestine. Three locations were originally
          suggested; his home village of al-Birwa, the neighboring village Jadeida, where some of Darwish's family still resides or in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Ramallah Mayor Janet Mikhail announced later that Darwish would be buried next to Ramallah's
          Palace of Culture, at the summit of a hill overlooking Jerusalem on the southwestern outskirts of Ramallah, and a shrine would be erected in his honor. Ahmed Darwish said "Mahmoud doesn't just belong to a family or a town, but to all the Palestinians,
          and he should be buried in a place where all Palestinians can come and visit him. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of mourning to honor Darwish and he was accorded the equivalent of a State funeral. A set of four postage
          stamps commemorating Darwish was issued in August 2008 by the PA. Arrangements for flying the body in from Texas delayed the funeral for a day. Darwish's body was then flown from Amman, Jordan for the burial in Ramallah. The first eulogy was
          delivered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to an orderly gathering of thousands. Several left-wing Knesset members attended the official ceremony; Mohammed Barakeh(Hadash) and Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al) stood with the family,
          and Dov Khenin (Hadash) and Jamal Zahalka (Balad) were in the hall at the Mukataa. Also present was the former French prime minister Dominique de Villepin. After the ceremony, Darwish's coffin was taken in a cortege at walking pace from the
          Mukataa to the Palace of Culture, gathering thousands of followers along the way. On 5 October 2008, the International Literature Festival Berlin held a worldwide reading in memory of <span class="MD-color"><strong><em>Mahmoud Darwish</em></strong></span>.

        <h3 id="Views-on-the-peace process" class="h3-css">Views on the peace process</h3>
        <p>Darwish consistently demanded a "tough and fair" stand in negotiations with Israel. Despite his criticism of both Israel and the Palestinian leadership, Darwish believed that peace was attainable. "I do not despair," he told the Israeli newspaper
          Haaretz. "I am patient and am waiting for a profound revolution in the consciousness of the Israelis. The Arabs are ready to accept a strong Israel with nuclear arms – all it has to do is open the gates of its fortress and make peace.

        <p>In 1988, one of his poems, "Passers Between the Passing Words," was cited in the Knesset by Yitzhak Shamir. Darwish was accused of demanding that the Jews leave Israel, although he claimed he meant the West Bank and Gaza: "So leave our land/Our
          shore, our sea/Our wheat, our salt, our wound." Adel Usta, a specialist on Darwish's poetry, said the poem was misunderstood and mistranslated. Poet and translator Ammiel Alcalay wrote that "the hysterical overreaction to the poem simply serves
          as a remarkably accurate litmus test of the Israeli psyche ... (the poem) is an adamant refusal to accept the language of the occupation and the terms under which the land is defined".

        <h3 id="2016-poem-controversy" class="h3-css">2016 poem controversy</h3>
        <p>In July 2016 a controversy erupted over the broadcasting of Darwish's song "ID card" on Galei Tzahal. Written in 1964, the song includes the lines:<br>
          <em>But if I starve.
I will eat my oppressor's flesh.<br>
Beware, beware of my starving.<br>
  And my rage.<br></em> This enraged Israel defense minister Avigdor Lieberman, who compared the poem to Hitler's Mein Kampf.

        <h3 id="Music-film" class="h3-css">Music and film</h3>
        <p>Many of Darwish's poems were set to music by Arab composers, among them Marcel Khalife, Reem Kelani, Majida El Roumi and Ahmad Qa'abour. The most notable are "Rita and the Rifle," "I lost a beautiful dream," "Birds of Galilee," and "I Yearn for
          my Mother's Bread." They have become anthems for at least two generations of Arabs. In the 1980s, Sabreen, a Palestinian group in Israel, recorded an album including versions of Darwish's poems "On Man" and "On Wishes".The composer Khalife was
          accused of blasphemy and insulting religious values because of his song entitled "I am Yusuf, oh my father," which he based on Darwish's lyrics, and which cited a verse from the Qur'an. In this poem, Darwish shared the pain of Yusuf (Joseph)
          who was rejected by his brothers, who fear him because he is too handsome and kind. "Oh my father, I am Yusuf / Oh father, my brothers neither love me nor want me in their midst". Darwish presents the story of Joseph as an allegory for the rejection
          of the Palestinians by the Israelis. Tamar Muskal, an Israeli-American composer, incorporated Dawish's "I Am From There" into her composition "The Yellow Wind," which combines a full orchestra, Arabic flute, Arab and Israeli poetry, and themes
          from David Grossman's book The Yellow Wind. Youseff M. Ibrahim, In 2002, Swiss composer Klaus Huber completed a large work entitled Die Seele muss vom Reittier Steigen…, a chamber concerto for cello, baritone and countertenor that incorporates
          Darwish's "The Soul Must Descend from its Mount and Walk on its Silken Feet". In 2008, Mohammed Fairouz set selections from State of Siege to music. In 2017, Roger Waters set to music an English translation of Darwish's "Lesson From the Kama
          Sutra (Wait for Her)" on his album Is This the Life We Really Want? in a song titled "Wait for Her".

        <p>In 1997, a documentary entitled <span class="MD-color"><strong><em>Mahmoud Darwish</em></strong></span> was produced by French TV, directed by French-Israeli director Simone Bitton. Darwish appeared as himself in Jean-Luc Godard's Notre Musique
          (2004). In 2008 Darwish starred in the five-screen film id – Identity of the Soul from Arts Alliance Productions, in which he narrates his poem "A Soldier Dreams of White Lilies" along with Ibsen's poem "Terje Vigen." Id was his final performance.
          It premiered in Palestine in October 2008, with audiences of tens of thousands. In 2010, the film was continuing an international screening tour. In 2009 Egin, a patchanka band from Italy, published in the album Des Maunet a song setting the
          poem "Identity Card" to music. In 2017, his poem "Think of Others" was made into a song set to music by a South African artist and 11- year old Palestinian activist, Janna Jihad Ayyad.
